List and Tuples
Question 1
What is the syntax to obtain the first element of the tuple?

A=('a','b','c')

A[0]
correct, the index 0 corresponds to the first element of a list or tuple.

Question 2
Consider the tuple A=((11,12),[21,22]), that contains a tuple and list. What is the result of the following operation A[1] ?

((11,12),[21,22])


[21,22]

Correct
correct, the index 1 corresponds to the second element in the tuple, which contains another list.

Question 3
Consider the tuple  A=((1),[2,3],[4]), that contains a tuple and list. What is the result of the following operation A[2][0]?
1 / 1 point


4

Correct
correct, A[2] corresponds to the third nested list; we then access the only element of the list using the index 0 i.e. A[2][0].

Question 4
What is the result of the following operation: 'A,B,C,D'.split(',') ?
1 / 1 point


['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']

correct, split returns a list of the words in the string, separated by the delimiter string, in this case, a comma.

Question 5
True or false: after applying the following method, L.append(['a','b']), the following list will only be one element longer.

1 / 1 point


 True
Correct
append only adds one element to a list


Question 6
 True or false: lists are mutable 
1 / 1 point


True


Correct
correct, lists are mutable tuples are not


Question 7
Consider the following list : A=["hard rock",10,1.2]

What will list A contain affter the following command is run: del(A[1]) ?

1 / 1 point

["hard rock",1.2]


Correct
correct , we will delete element 1 

Question 8
What is the syntax to clone the list A and assign the result to list B ?
1 / 1 point


B=A[:]

Correct
correct

Question 9
What is the result of the following: len(("disco",10,1.2, "hard rock",10)) ?
1 / 1 point


5


correct, there are 5 elements in the tuple so the function len returns 5
